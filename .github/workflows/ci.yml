## Our CI consists in two kind of jobs: the `docker-based` ones and the
## `github-hosted` ones. Both come with their upsides and downsides.
##
## - `docker-based` jobs rely on the `ocaml/opam` Docker images [1]. These come
##   with a variety of tags allowing to selected between various versions of
##   OCaml and, more importantly for us, between various OSs (several Linux
##   distributions as well as some Windows images). However, OPAM's sandboxing
##   mechanism, based on `bubblewrap` [2], does not behave well in Docker and it
##   is unavailable in those images [3].
##
## - `github-hosted` jobs rely on the default GitHub Actions runners and the
##   `ocaml/setup-ocaml` action [4]. This offers more limited OSes (limited to
##   Ubuntu, Windows and macOS) but it is compatible with OPAM's sandboxing
##   mechanism.
##
## We need to test that our package behaves well with the OPAM sandboxing
## because Cargo does use network to build by default, which will not be
## available in the sandbox, and which we therefore need to catch in CI.
## Therefore, we need to include these `github-hosted` jobs.
##
## However, we also want to test that our package installs fine on a variety of
## distributions because it depends heavily on detecting external dependencies
## (namely Cargo and Rustc) and installing them correctly. Therefore, we also
## need to include these `docker-based` jobs.
